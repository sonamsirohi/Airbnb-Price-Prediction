# Airbnb-Price-Prediction
Airbnb Price Prediction using Gradient Boosting. Flask web app that predicts price per bed from features like rooms, guests, reviews, ratings &amp; country.

üè° Airbnb Price Prediction (Gradient Boosting) ‚Äî Flask App

This project is an end-to-end ML web app that predicts price per bed for Airbnb listings. Users enter features (bedrooms, bathrooms, guests, beds, country, rating, reviews, check-in/out times) and the app returns an estimated price.
Under the hood, a Gradient Boosting Regressor learns non-linear relationships between features and price. The pipeline covers data cleaning (especially messy time strings), model training/evaluation, and a Flask front end with a clean UI.

Use it to showcase full-stack ML skills: data ‚Üí model ‚Üí deployment. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to run locally, and simple to extend (e.g., add city/seasonality, dynamic pricing).

You can fill the essential details like the bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, guests, country and reviews and you will be able to see the predicted price.
